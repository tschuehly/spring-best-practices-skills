# jOOQ Best Practices

Expert knowledge base for jOOQ 3.20 DSL usage, SQL patterns, and Kotlin integration.
Built from official docs + 783 blog articles (progressively updated).

## How to use

1. Reference the knowledge files below for patterns, best practices, and real-world examples
2. If you hit a compile error or conflict with a knowledge entry, use the **jOOQ MCP server** to check current syntax

## Core rules (always apply)

- Target version: **jOOQ 3.20** on PostgreSQL
- Use jOOQ DSL in repository classes, never raw SQL in controllers/services
- Map results to Kotlin data classes
- Use `record.FIELD` not `record.get(field)` for type safety
- Use jOOQ-generated enums, don't replicate DB enums in Kotlin
- Prefer `fetchMap(KEY, VALUE)` with `coerceTo()` for aggregates
- Wrap multi-step DB operations in `@Transactional`
- Use `DSL.name("cte").as(select...)` for CTEs
- Use `EXISTS()` not `COUNT(*) > 0` for existence checks
- Use `NOT EXISTS` instead of `NOT IN` with nullable columns
- Prefer `UNION ALL` over `UNION` unless dedup is needed
- Prefer `FILTER (WHERE ...)` over `CASE` in aggregates — more readable and faster on PostgreSQL
- Always execute jOOQ queries through jOOQ — don't extract SQL for JDBC/JPA (loses MULTISET emulation, type-safe mapping, R2DBC)
