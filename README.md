**[jvmskills.com](https://jvmskills.com)** — AI coding skills from the engineers who build the JVM ecosystem.

Skills are opinionated best-practice guides that AI coding tools (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) use as context when writing code. The directory helps JVM developers discover, evaluate, and adopt high-quality skills for their stack.

## Why?

AI coding tools are only as good as their context. Without guidance, they generate code that *works* but doesn't follow the patterns a senior engineer would use. jvm-skills fills that gap with strongly opinionated best practices.

General skill directories exist (playbooks.com, skills.sh, skillsdirectory.com), but they're not focused on a specific ecosystem — and many of the top-installed skills are surprisingly shallow. The most popular Spring Boot skill on skills.sh has 9.8K installs and just tells the AI to "use Spring Boot best practices." That's not a skill — Claude already does that without one. jvm-skills only lists skills that teach the AI something it wouldn't know on its own.

## Local Development

```bash
# Requires Kotlin (https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html)
# Build once
kotlin site/build.main.kts
open dist/index.html

# Or use the live-reload dev server
./site/watch.sh
```
